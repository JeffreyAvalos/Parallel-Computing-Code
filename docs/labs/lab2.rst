Parallel Computing Lab 2
========================

The lab 2 is to practice how to write a SPMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) parallel program in OpenMP. The lab computes the sum of a billion numbers.:: 

	cd labs/lab2
	make
	make run

You need to revise the loop_omp.cpp file by adding OpenMP parallel region inside.
